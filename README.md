# Spring Boot Rest Client (RestTemplate)

This is a simple demo of using the RestTemplate API 
in Spring Boot to make CRUD requests.
This project is a client of another project [https://github.com/gxshub/spring-boot-entity-relationship](https://github.com/gxshub/spring-boot-entity-relationship).
To run this project, the other project must be running. 

The RestTemplate API Doc is in [https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/client/RestTemplate.html](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/client/RestTemplate.html).
